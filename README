Prints the power of 2 in the prime factorization of the nonnegative integers.

The exclusive upper bound of the integers printed by `twos` is set with the
CNT #define in twos.cpp.

To compile `twos`:
	make twos

The default output is a series of lines in the format
	{num}: {exponent}

{exponent} is the power of 2 in the prime factorization of {num}. For
instance:
	240: 4
means that the prime factorization of 240 has 2^4 in it. This can be
independently verified by using `factor`:
	$ factor 240
	240: 2 2 2 2 3 5

A more complete automatic verification can be produced:
	$ factor 240 | tr ' ' '\n' | grep '^2$' | wc -l
	4

To generate data and plot it using gnu plot:
	./twos > twos.dat
	./plot_twos.sh
